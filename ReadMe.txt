This code analyzes the torque alignment of a 1969 Ford Mustang Sportsroof 200 Six under various steering angles. It begins by setting up the necessary variables and parameters for the car, such as mass, rolling coefficient, gravitational acceleration, wheelbase, front weight, KPI (Kingpin Inclination) angle, nominal radius, steering angle, caster angle, scrub radius, and pneumatic and mechanical parameters.

The code then calculates the longitudinal and lateral forces acting on the car based on coefficients of adhesion and weight. These forces are used to calculate torque components in the X, Y, and Z directions.

The torque alignment, defined as the combination of torque components in the X, Y, and Z directions, is calculated and plotted against the steering angle. A table is also generated to display the torque components and torque alignment values for each steering angle.

Overall, this code provides insights into the torque alignment of the Ford Mustang Sportsroof 200 Six as a function of steering angle, helping to understand the torque distribution and behavior of the vehicle during different steering maneuvers.
